This is a more general version of randomGen2 that can take in a SQL statement which will
tell the procedure which table to select from.



Example:

CREATE TABLE paramTable SELECT * FROM taster
JOIN wineReviews ON tasterFk=tasterId
JOIN location ON locFk=locId
WHERE country = "France";

ALTER tABLE paramTable ADD COLUMN (randId INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS randomGen;

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE randomGen(IN cnt INT)

BEGIN
  DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS randTable;
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE randTable ( randId INT );

loop_me: LOOP
    IF cnt < 1 THEN
      LEAVE loop_me;
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO randTable
       SELECT wineReviews.id
         FROM wineReviews JOIN
              (SELECT (RAND() *
                            (SELECT MAX(id)
                               FROM wineReviews)) AS randId)
               AS temp
        WHERE wineReviews.id >= temp.randId
        ORDER BY wineReviews.id ASC
        LIMIT 1;

    SET cnt = cnt - 1;
  END LOOP loop_me;
END//

DELIMITER ;
