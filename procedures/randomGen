This procedure takes one input (cnt) which determines how many random number to generate
(within the range of IDs in the wine reviews table).

It puts these in a table called 'randTable'. After calling the procedure, you can make a query like...

"SELECT variety, description, FROM wineReviews, randTable WHERE wineReviews.id IN (randTable.randId)"

CREATE PROCEDURE randomGen(IN cnt INT)

BEGIN
  DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS randTable;
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE randTable ( randId INT );

loop_me: LOOP
    IF cnt < 1 THEN
      LEAVE loop_me;
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO randTable
       SELECT wineReviews.id
         FROM wineReviews JOIN
              (SELECT (RAND() *
                            (SELECT MAX(id)
                               FROM wineReviews)) AS id)
               AS temp
        WHERE wineReviews.id >= temp.id
        ORDER BY wineReviews.id ASC
        LIMIT 1;

    SET cnt = cnt - 1;
  END LOOP loop_me;
END//
