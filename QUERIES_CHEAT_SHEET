Select * from wineReviews join location on locFk = locId;

Joining to taster table is similar….
select * from wineReviews join taster on tasterFk=tasterId;

**********************************************************

An example of finding distinct entries by an aggregate function. In this case, it finds only the max price wines for
each country :
SELECT substr(bigJoin.description, 1, 20), bigJoin.country, bigJoin.price
FROM bigJoin
INNER JOIN
	(select country, max(price) maxP
	from bigJoin
	group by country) b
ON (bigJoin.country = b.country AND bigJoin.price = b.maxP) order by country;
